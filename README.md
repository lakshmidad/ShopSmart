# PriceCompareX (scaffold)

This repository contains a frontend scaffold for the PriceCompareX project.

Quick start:

1. Open the project folder in your editor.
2. Serve files using a simple static server (or open `index.html` in the browser).

Example (PowerShell) to start a quick server if you have Python:

```powershell
python -m http.server 5500
# then open http://localhost:5500/index.html
```

Branch workflow:

- Create feature branches named `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g. `feature/layout-setup`).

This commit added the scaffold. Next: implement the landing page UI.
